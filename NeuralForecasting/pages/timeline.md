# Timeline

## Development phase
This phase should be used to tune your models, testing against a small
set of testing data

## Final phase

Resubmit your preferred submission from the development phase to test
against a new set of final secret test data. Your model will be trained against
the same set of training data as in the development phase. You may only
make one submission to this phase, so choose wisely.

## Challenge preservation 

After the challenge competition award ceremony, we will release all the datasets for future research based on the FAIR principle.
