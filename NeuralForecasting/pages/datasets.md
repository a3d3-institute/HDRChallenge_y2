The motor neural activity forecasting dataset includes recorded neural signals from 2 monkeys performing reaching activities, Monkey A and Monkey B, using $\mu$ECoG arrays. Recorded neural signals are in the form of multivariate continuous time series, with variables corresponding to recording electrodes in the recording array. The dataset includes all 239 electrodes from Monkey A and 87 electrodes, specifically from the M1 region of Monkey B. We include 985 training samples, 122 validation samples, 122 within-session testing samples, while Monkey B contains 700 training, 87 validation, and 87 within-session testing samples. Two additional Monkey samples from previous studies are also included for further validation (2308 samples)~\cite{SussilloDavid2015Annt}.
